      <description>In this project we have curated 28 stereo recordings of traditional Scandinavian fiddle tunes with accompanying foot-tapping, which is standard performance practice within these musical styles. Its corpora contains not only the mixed signals, but also the two isolated instrumental tracks that can be used to train supervised models for source separation.
 The fiddle track (harmonic); The foot-tapping track (percussive).  Moreover, foot-tapping in performance of fiddle music has not been systematically studied yet, even though it very often appears as an integral part of the musical expression in Scandinavian fiddle music as a percussive accompaniment.</description>

      <description>Description This repository includes all the code I have done in 2017 for my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree Final project. The project consisted of my own implementation in MATLAB of the algorithm for unsupervised source separation based on the concept of Average Harmonic Structure (AHS) modelling that has been proposed on the following paper:
 Z. Duan, Y. Zhang, C. Zhang and Z. Shi, &amp;ldquo;Unsupervised Single-Channel Music Source Separation by Average Harmonic Structure Modeling&amp;rdquo;, in IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, vol.</description>
